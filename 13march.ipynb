Listwise deletion may result in a smaller sample size and reduced statistical power, and may introduce bias if the missing data is related to the outcome or other variables of interest. Pairwise deletion may also reduce statistical power and may lead to biased estimates if the missing data is not missing completely at random. Mean imputation may introduce bias if the missing data is not missing completely at random and may underestimate the standard error of the estimate. Multiple imputation is often considered the best method as it retains the full sample size, preserves the uncertainty associated with the missing data, and provides valid standard errors and p-values.
